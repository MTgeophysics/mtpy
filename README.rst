Conventions Used in the MTPy Software
=====================================

1. MTpy uses E- and B-fields (although the sensors may be confusingly named as H-sensors in EDI files)
2. [E] = microvolts/meter (muV/m)
3. [B] = nanotesla (nT)
4. [Z] = [E]/[B] = km/s
5. Apparent resistivty rho = 0.2 * T * |Z|^2  (in Ohm m)
6. Angles are given in degrees (mod 360)
7. EDI files can contain data in Z- or rho/phi-form
8. EDI files contain data from one station only
9. Coordinates are handled in decimal degrees (converted when reading)
10. Time stamps refer to UTC
11. Internal coordinates: X = North-South, Y = East-West
12. Rotations are interpreted clockwise (mathematically negative)
13. 0 degrees azimuth = North
