CHANGELOG METADATA STANDARDS
================================
	* ‘/’ in metadata name replaced with ‘.’
	* removed _type from metadata name
	* change to all lower case names
	* change notes to comments
	* nested all start, end date/times under time_period
	* removed all datum except at the survey level to make sure everything is consistent.
	* removed all url cause they never work.
	
	* Survey
		- Changed survey to name
		- Changed location to geographic_location
		- nest start and end under time_period
		- removed acquired_by.email and .url cause redundant, the user can get this from the doi.
		- added acquired_by.comments as a free field to input any comments
		- changed id to archive_id
		- changed net_code to archive_network
		- removed conditions_of_use because redundant with release_status
		- added project_lead.name .email, .organization as can be different from acquired by.
		
	* Station
		- nested lat, lon, elevation, declination under location
		- nested start, end under time_period
		- nested orientation options under orientation
		- Remove acquired_by email and url
		- renamed sta_code to archive_id
		- renamed name to id
		- added geographic_name for additional searching
		- added channel layout
		- removed declination.epoch and added declination.comments.  Epoch can be attained from the model.
		
	* DataLogger
		- Change battery.start_voltage_d to battery.voltage.start_d
		
	* Run
		- nested start/end under time_period
		- nested data_logger info under run
		- added metadata_by.author, metadata_by.comments
		- changed channels_recorded to channels_recorded_auxiliary, channels_recorded_eletric, channels_recorded_magnetic
		
	
	* Channel
		- Add 'type' to distinguish what type of metadata is needed.
		- Add location to auxiliary channels for consistency.
		- nested lat, lon, elevation, declination under location
		- changed azimuth to measurement_azimuth for clarity
		- made most field notes, like ac, dc, contact resistance as optional
		- changed data_quality to have a rating category --> data_quality.rating.author, data_quality.rating.value, data_quality.rating.method
		- removed data_quality.warning_flags
		- changed data_quailty.warning_notes to data_quality.warning_comments
	
	* Electric
		- Change electric.contact_resistance.start_B_d to electric.contact_resitance.start where start can be a list

	* Magnetic
		- Change magnetic.h_field.start_min_d to magnetic.h_field_min.start
		Change magnetic.h_field.start_max_d to magnetic.h_field_max.start
		- nested lat, lon, elevation, declination under location
		-
