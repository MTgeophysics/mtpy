    Converts Occam2D profile to Mare2D format, giving station locations

    The idea here is to generate the horizontal component of the line
    from the rotated Occam2D profile, but get the profile and station
    elevations from the non-rotated profile. From discussion with AK:

    "...We need to take the elevations from where the data are actually
    located... I’m not sure if it makes sense to display the elevations
    at the projected location because this depends on the position of the
    profile, but the actual position of the profile doesn’t really
    matter in the inversion as we assume resistivity is the same along
    strike"

    Doesn't handle if the `rot_o2d_data` isn't actually rotated, will
    end up working with duplicates. This isn't a problem, just
    inefficient.

    Parameters
    ----------
    o2d_data : mtpy.modeling.occam2d.Data
        Occam2D Data object that has been initialised with EDI data and
        *not* rotated to strike angle.
    rot_o2d_data : mtpy.modeling.occam2d.Data
        Occam2D Data object that has been initialised with EDI data nd
        *is* rotated to strike angle.
    surface_file : str or bytes
        Full path to ASCII grid file containing topography data.
    elevation_sample_n : int, optional
        Number of points to sample from the Occam2D profile for
        for loading into Mare2D. According to original script this
        should be changed to something sensible based on length of the
        profile line.
    flip_elevation : bool, optional
        If True, elevation is multiplied by -1 after interpolation.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing (mare origin, utm_zone,

        profile line in UTM coordinates. utm_zone is the UTM string of
        the Mare2D profile origin. Site locations are the locations of
        the site in Mare2D coordinates. Site elevations are elevation
        of sites in metres (interpolated from surface_file). Mare2DEM
        profile is the full profile line in Mare2D coordinates.
        Elevation is the elevation of the Mare2D profile line.
