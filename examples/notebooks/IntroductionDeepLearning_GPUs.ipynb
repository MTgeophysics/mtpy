For example, hard corners and straight edges might be believed to indicate the presence of manmade objects in the scene.  The responses from these feature extraction functions would then be fed into another function which would decide whether to declare a particular object had been detected in the image.\n",

Secondly, it is a massive task to come up with the right combination of features for every type of object you want to be able to classify.  Thirdly, it is very difficult to design functions that are robust to translations, rotations and scalings of objects in the image.  Together these problems resulted in traditional computer vision struggling to develop high accuracy object detectors and classifiers for a broad range of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DL system that you saw demonstrated above was created in a very different way.  No human knowledge was encoded in the DL model about the types and combinations of features that are important for labelling different types of object or scene.  Instead, a combined feature extraction and classification model was learned by allowing the computer to examine millions of ground-truth labelled images to discover which features and combinations of features were most discriminative for each of the object classes (In machine learning we call this 'training' the model).  Furthermore, this was done in such a way that the model didn't just learn to classify the specific objects it was trained on; instead, it abstracted out the essence of those objects in such a way that it could recognize previously unseen but visually similar objects.  This learning process refined tens of millions of free parameters in the DL model above to be able to accurately classify 1000 different object types.  On a traditional CPU based server this training would take weeks to complete.  This network was instead trained in just hours by exploiting GPU acceleration.  Almost all DL systems today exploit massive GPU acceleration to make training practical.\n",

    "## What is Deep Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL) is a branch of artificial intelligence research that is attempting to develop the techniques that will allow computers to learn complex perception tasks such as seeing and hearing at human levels of performance.  Recent advances in DL have yielded startling performance gains in fields such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language understanding.  DL is already in use today to understand data and user inputs in technologies such as virtual personal assistants and online image search.  DL is an active area of ongoing research where it is envisaged that human level perception of unstructured data will enable technologies such as self-driving cars and truly intelligent machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "DL attempts to use large volumes of unstructured data, such as images and audio clips, to learn hierarchical models which capture the complex structure in the data and then use these models to predict properties of previously unseen data.  For example, DL has proven extremely successful at learning hierarchical models of the visual features and concepts represented in handheld camera images and then using those models to automatically label previously unseen images with the objects present in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models learned through DL are biologically inspired artificial neural networks (ANNs).  An ANN is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain. In the image below, each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one neuron to the input of another.  Input data is fed into the red nodes, and dependent on the weights on the connections between nodes, causes varying levels of activation of the subsequent hidden and output nodes.  In our example above the input nodes would be connected to image pixels and the output nodes would have a one-to-one correspondence with the possible object classes; the job of the hidden nodes is to learn the complex function which maps pixels to object labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "![ANN](files/DLIntro/ANN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">*Figure 3:  Fully-connected Artificial Neural Network with one hidden layer*</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the advanced reader, the activation of a neuron is just a function of a variable which is the weighted sum of the inputs.  For basic neural networks the function is a sigmoid function.  The idea is that if the weighted sum of the inputs exceeds a threshold value, the neuron gives a positive output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ANNs to be effective in difficult perception tasks, such as object labelling in images, these networks usually have many stacked layers of artificial neurons each with many neurons in the layer.  It is these many wide layers that lead to these networks being labelled Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "One particular class of DNN which has shown great capability in visual perception tasks is called the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  CNNs have a structure which loosely resembles the structure the human visual cortex where lower levels of the model hierarchy are focused on small and local visual details, such as oriented line segments, which aggregate together into higher levels of the model which correspond to complex human concepts, such as faces and animals.\n",

    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">*Figure 4:  Deep Neural Networks learn a hierarchical model of the input data in which the layers correspond to increasingly complex real-world concepts.  The number of parameters in a network is a function of the number of neurons in the network and the architecture of the network connectivity.*</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Imagenet Challenge](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/index) is an annual competition where competitors are provided with 1.2 million natural images from the internet which are labelled with the objects that appear in those images using 1000 different class labels.  Competitors must create a model using this data which will then be tested against a further 100,000 images to see how accurately the model can identify and localize objects within them.  Over the past few years CNN based approaches have come to dominate the competition with accuracy in the object identification task recently exceeding 95% - which is comparable with human performance in labelling the objects in the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematics that underpins DL training is predominantly linear matrix algebra.  Computation of this type of mathematics is highly parallelizable making it a perfect fit for acceleration using GPUs.  Training a DNN that can be competitive in the Imagenet challenge is computationally very intensive and would take weeks, months or even years of computation on a CPU based system.  Through massive parallelization, GPUs can reduce this training time to days or even hours. Now almost all entrants into the Imagenet Challenge use GPUs, sometimes many of them, to train CNNs with billions of trainable parameters.  The graph below shows how significant recent improvements in accuracy in the Imagenet challenge correlate with the explosion in the use of GPUs for training DNN entries.\n",

    "DL is not only applicable to image data, there have been many recent successes applying DL to understanding natural language text.    One important class of DNNs for natural language understanding is called Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).  RNNs extend the standard multi-layer DNN with a temporal memory component that means the network can learn sequential patterns in input data.  This works by having the hidden layers in the network receive both a new data sample as well as their state at the previous time step as input at each iteration. This means that RNNs can learn functions such as time-series forecasting, music generation, natural language word sequences and character level text sequence prediction.  In the example below you see an RNN receiving the sequence \"Hello world!\" as training input in three character windows with a stride of three characters.\n",

    "In this example we will show that an RNN built in Torch and trained on a variety of corpora of different styles of text is able to learn to generate random character sequence that retain the appropriate style, vocabulary, punctuation and formatting.  Given a large volume of training text (between 1.1 and 6.2 million training characters per model) the model learns to predict the next character in a partial character sequence; this means the model can generate original text conforming to the same style as the text it has been trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training the RNN capable of generating this style appropriate text takes about an hour per text corpus on an NVIDIA GRID K520 GPU running Torch.  Training the same network on a CPU would take about 100 times as long.  We have already done that GPU training for you. We made use of the excellent [code](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) written by Andrej Karpathy, a graduate student at Stanford. We highly recommend reading Andrej's fascinating blog post associated with this code describing [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of RNNs](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).  \n",

    "Edit the style variable in the cell below to choose a trained network and then run it to see the Torch based RNN randomly generate text in one of the following styles:  William Shakespeare, Leo Tolstoy, President Barack Obama's speech writers or the Linux kernal source code authors.  You can also try increasing the `-length` input to get more text, but it will take longer to generate.\n",
