Plots data/model misfit for a given period, at all sites, separately for each
of the impedance tensor modes + tipper

Revision History:
    brenainn.moushall@ga.gov.au 31-03-2020 13:42:41 AEDT:
        - Add option for plotting impedance or tippers
        - Add shapefile creation
        - Allow specifying period in seconds
        - Add plotting on geotiff background

# Parameter explanations (TODO: add to user guide):

# plot_elements: can plot only impedance or tippers by setting to
# 'impedance' or 'tippers'. Set as 'both' or leave out to plot impedance
# and tippers.

# bimg: path to a geotiff to use as map background image. If the CRS of
# the geotiff and the model differ, then 'PlotRMSMaps.model_epsg' must
# also be provided so model coordinates can be correctly projected onto
# the geotiff.

# period: can choose period by providing 'period_index' or by providing
# period in seconds to 'period'. If 'period' is provided it will take
# priority over 'period_index'. The closest available period will be
# selected, so the plotted period may be different from what was chosen.

# Can write RMS map as shapefiles by calling 'create_shapefiles'. This
# will use the period, plot_elements etc. attributes provided to the
# PlotRMSMaps class above.

# dst_epsg: the CRS of the shapefile output. This should be set to the
# EPSG code of the geotiff the shapefiles are intended to be displayed
# on.

# save_path: an optional save_path. If not provided, will save to the
# PlotRMSMaps.save_path atribute. Shapefiles will be saved within
# subdirectories labelled with component and period within this
# directory.
