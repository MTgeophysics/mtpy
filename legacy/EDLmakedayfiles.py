This is a convenience script for the generation of dayfiles. 
It needs the location of a folder with time series and the sampling period as arguments.

The time series files have to be named in the EDL-ascii output standard, 
which codes stationname and start time of the file in the name. 

The data have to be either single column values or in 2-column form.

        wrapper for the generation of dayfiles for EDL data.

        2 mandatory arguments: 
        - path to files 
        - sampling interval (in seconds)

        3 optional arguments:
        - name of the output directory - cannot start with '-' 
        - stationname - cannot start with '-' 
        - flag '-R (or -r)', if the directory shall be searched for data recursively
