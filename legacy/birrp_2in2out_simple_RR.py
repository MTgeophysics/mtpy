Convenience script for running BIRRP with one remote reference. 

arguments:
birrp executable, stationname, remote refernce station name, directory containing time series files

optional:
coherence threshold, start time of processing, end time of processing

A subfolder 'birrp_wd_rr' for the output is generated within the current directory
